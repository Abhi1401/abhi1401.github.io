      I'm currently an Application Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.oracle.com/" target="_blank">Oracle</a> With experience working on multi tenant, cloud native, microservice based REST/SOAP web application deployed in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

      As a software engineer, I find intense pleasure in understanding new designs/algorithms and building/breaking things to find solutions, combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.
